## Features

- Allows for non-standard HEX codes to be applied as crew colors.
- Automatically appends valid suffixes to non-working HEX codes until a supported combination is found.

## How to Use

### 1. Add the Bookmarklet to Your Browser
To use the tool, you need to add the bookmarklet to your browser's bookmarks:

1. Copy the following code:

    ```javascript
    javascript:(function(){const script=document.createElement('script');script.src='https://ajmagrajag.github.io/Rockstar-Crew-Colours/colourTool.js';document.body.appendChild(script);})();
    ```

2. Open your browser's bookmarks bar.
3. Right-click on the bar and choose **"Add Page"** or **"Bookmark this page"**.
4. Enter a name for the bookmark (e.g., `Rockstar Crew Colors`) and paste the code into the **URL** field.
5. Save the bookmark.

---

### 2. Run the Bookmarklet on Rockstar Social Club
1. Go to the **Manage Crew** section of Rockstar Social Club:
   - Example URL: `https://socialclub.rockstargames.com/crew/YOUR_CREW_NAME/manage/edit`
2. Click on the bookmarklet you just saved.
3. When prompted, enter your desired HEX color code (e.g., `#262425` or `262425ff`).
4. The tool will:
   - Validate your HEX code.
   - Attempt to set the color directly if it's supported.
   - If not supported, it will append suffixes like `ff`, `a`, etc., to find a working combination.

5. A success or failure message will appear.

## Troubleshooting

### The Prompt Doesn't Appear
If the prompt doesn't appear after clicking the bookmarklet:
- Ensure you are on the **Manage Crew** page of Rockstar Social Club.
- Check your browser's developer console for errors (`F12` â†’ **Console** tab).
- Make sure the script URL in your bookmarklet is correct.
- Try refreshing the page

### The HEX Code Doesn't Work
If your HEX code doesn't work:
- Ensure the HEX code is 6 or 8 characters long (e.g., `262425` or `262425ff`).
- The tool will automatically append valid suffixes, but not all colors are supported by Rockstar.
